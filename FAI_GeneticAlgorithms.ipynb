    "The [Eight Queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) is a famous puzzle that has been studied extensively in- and outside of computer science. It was first published in the chess magazine _Schach_ in 1848. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem can be formulated as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "_\"Place 8 queens on a regular (8x8) chess board such that no queen attacks any other queen.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "A queen in the game of chess can move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. The puzzle can be solved by hand (and even [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss) studied it back in 1850).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal for task 1 is to use genetic algorithms to obtain a fast solution to the 8 queens problem. The first task will start at n = 8, that is, completing the problem for a standard chessboard."

    "### Task 3: Explanation of algorithms and implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In task 1, the choice of algorithm was a base level genetic algorithm that was implemented using the outline provided by Russell and Norvig in the course content. The algorithm uses a starting population of 18 as this would optimise both time and space, ensuring that computing power is minimised whilst also ensuring a solution is converged upon quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key implementation choices made for this algorithm was the selection criteria. A simple set of selection criteria are chosen - a probability based selection method which uses the weights found through the fitness function. The fitness function returns the weights for each individual, with a total weight of 1. These weights are used as the probabilities for the parent-pair selection, favouring low-cost solutions whilst also not discounting high-cost solutions. This ensures that diversity is maintained in the population so the solution iterations do not get stuck. Another key decision was the crossover step. In this step, the decision was made for the crossover point to be chosen at random. Once again, this was done to increase the diversity of the solution pool so that a solution could be converged upon faster. Finally, another key decision was the mutation rate. At first, the rate was set to 5%, but after trial-and-error, the rate was found to have more success at 10% as a larger mutation rate would help keep the population heterogeneous and reduce the time taken to find a solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "The task 1 algorithm and implementation had some key decisions that makes the algorithm perform well - reaching solutions quickly, whilst minimising the spatial complexity of the solution. However, one issue that the algorithm faces is that the population can homogenise quite quickly, resulting in countless generations in which there is no progresss.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of task 2 was to use new techniques to improve the existing genetic algorithm. As the solution converging to a local minima had caused issues during my work in task 1, the work of Vasconcelos et al. provided a great starting point from which an adaptive mutation algorithm was used (2001). Conclusions reached by Patil and Bhende mirror this sentiment, as mutation-based algorithms provide a solid starting point to improve the time to convergence and can help maintain genetic diversity in the population (2014). \n",
    "\n",
    "Even while keeping the other parameters - board size and population size the same, the dynamic mutation algorithm produced faster results in general. The algorithm followed the psuedocode provided by Vasconcelos et al. to tune the mutation rate according to a genetic diversity parameter (gdm). This parameter is the ratio of the maximum value of the fitness function to the mean of the fitness function. If the maximum value is the mean, then there is no diversity in the population and the parameter is equal to 1. Vasconcelos et al. provided parameters that were used in comparison - based on the gdm, the value of Pm, the probability of mutation, would increase or decrease based on thresholds. That is to say, if genetic diversity is lower, then the probability of mutation increases, and as genetic diversity increases, the parameter correspondingly decreases (2001). The rate of this parameter change may need to be tuned as it may cause excess mutations in states where minimal mutations are needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, after completing a basic test in the cell above, where the average number of generations to converge to a solution (albeit on a board of n=7 to speed up the overall time required for the test) was obtained over 50 simulations each. Completing 50 simulations reduces the chance of lucky starting seeds or mutations from dominating the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a substantial improvement by the dynamic mutation algorithm - requiring 29.7% less generations to complete the task. This is in agreement with the findings of Patil and Bhende, where they state that an algorithm similar to the one implemented can converge upon a solution quickly (2014). This reduces the computational requirements of the overall algorithm especially for large search spaces, while maintaining the same level of spatial complexity - only minimal amounts of extra information are stored. Thus, it can be seen that the genetic algorithm with dynamic mutation is a very effective improvement of the algorithm.\n",
